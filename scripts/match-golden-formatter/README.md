# Reformat Golden JSON for MATCH Compatibility

## What is this script?

This script exists to reformat our golden JSON dataset into a format acceptable by MATCH.

## How do I run these scripts?

This script is started with the "python" command (ex. python example_script.py). This script takes two required parameters, input_file and output_file_name. The input_file is the path of goldeon JSON file and the output_file_name is simply the name that will be given to the final saved file. This script accepts a help parameter which will repeat this information (-h, --help). <br/>
