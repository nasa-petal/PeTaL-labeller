# MATCH on PeTaL Data Notebooks

## What is this?

This directory contains work done in Jupyter Notebooks, originally run in Google Colaboratory, for investigating the use of the MATCH (https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/MATCH) algorithm to classify Lens output data according to the PeTaL taxonomy.

This README was last updated on 20 July 2021.

## What are all these files?

- `prediction_metrics.ipynb`, in progress, is an attempt to compute various classification metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix) for MATCH run on the MAG-CS dataset.
- `run_MATCH_with_PeTaL_data.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook evaluating the performance of MATCH on PeTaL data.

## How do I reproduce your results?

- Step through `run_MATCH_with_PeTaL_data.ipynb`.
